INF601 - Jupyter Blog
Jeramee Oliver
<br>Final Project

## Description
A small personal blog that includes jupyter functionality. This project is a practical application of computer science and data science in real-time. The design remains minimalistic, functional, and aligned with the basic requirements, offering a straightforward yet insightful experience. In my programming journey, I exceled in data science and micro-controller domains. Acknowledging my weakness in web development, I am actively working to strengthen this area, emphasizing a commitment to addressing and improving my proficiency in all facets of programming.
